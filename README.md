# ops-201d7-code-challenges

What is this repo all about?
Why are you learning these skills?
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

This repo was for Ops 201 coding challenges. We are presented with these challenges to introduce us to practical uses of scripting and the languages we may come across. 



My favorite ops challenge was a bash script where we could enter a PID from the tasklist and have it terminate.
Each challenge taught something important, but this particular challenge felt like the first introduction to something directly applicable.



Over time I will continue to learn bash and another language such as python or ruby. 
I know we will need these languages to automate redundant tasks in the career field, and the challenges served only as an introduction. My lack of proficiency is still clear to me.
